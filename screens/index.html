                This is the website which I've created with the help of w3schools.
                I hope you gonna like my website. Thank you!!The writing system of raised
                dots used by blind and visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille
                in nineteenth-century France. In a society that did not value disabled people
                in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading
                and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile
                reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were
                difficult to learn and use.
